# Data Science 4950 Capstone Project
The goal of this project is to create a predictive model capable of determining the approximate number of operational cycles a jet engine can complete before failure. The data used in this project is provided by NASA. The data contained features for the number of completed cycles, operational setting values, and sensor measurement values. After exploratory analysis and feature selection, three different modeling techniques are applied to predict RUL in the test dataset. Of the three created, a model using the Random Forrest regression technique was determined to be most successful, explaining about 70% of variance in the testing data. The major limitations of the project include the computational cost of building the Random Forest along with the lack of advanced features selected for the models.
